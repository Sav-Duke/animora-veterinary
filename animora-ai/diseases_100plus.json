          "modality": "Intramammary (Local) Antibiotics",
          "details": [
            "Used for local infection to achieve high drug concentration directly at the site of infection within the mammary gland.",
            "Administration is via infusion directly into the teat canal of the affected quarter."

          "target_pathogens": [
            "Contagious pathogens (e.g., **Streptococcus agalactiae**, *Staphylococcus aureus*)",
            "Environmental pathogens (e.g., **E. coli**, **Klebsiella spp.**, environmental *Streptococcus*)"
          ],
          "antibiotics": [
            "**Cloxacillin** (effective against many Gram-positive bacteria)",
            "**Cephapirin** (a cephalosporin, broad spectrum)",
            "**Pirlimycin** (a lincosamide, effective against many Gram-positive bacteria, often for *Staph. aureus*)",
            "**Penicillin** (effective against Gram-positive bacteria like *Streptococcus*)"
          ],
          "preparation_and_administration": [
            "1. **Milk out the affected quarter** completely before infusion.",
            "2. **Clean the teat end** thoroughly with an alcohol swab or medicated wipe provided with the tube. This is the **most critical step** to prevent introducing environmental bacteria deeper into the udder.",
            "3. **Infuse the antibiotic tube** into the teat canal, using the **partial insertion technique** (inserting only the tip of the cannula) to minimize damage to the keratin plug.",
            "4. **Gently massage the antibiotic** up into the cistern and gland, starting from the teat end and moving upwards.",
            "5. **Dip the teat** immediately after infusion with a post-milking teat dip to seal the teat end."
          ],
          "considerations": [
            "**Withdrawal Period:** Always observe the milk and meat withdrawal times printed on the product label to prevent illegal antibiotic residues in the food supply.",
            "**Duration:** Treatment usually lasts for 3 to 8 consecutive infusions, depending on the product and the pathogen.",
            "**Type:** Use products labeled for **Lactation** for treating cows currently producing milk, and products labeled for the **Dry Period** (long-acting) when the cow is non-lactating."
